HOW TO DOWNLOAD A SNAPSHOT OF CHILD FROM THE OXFORD REPOSITORY

G. Tucker
April, 2003

This describes the steps you need to take in order to obtain a snapshot
of the CHILD source code and associated files from the code repository
held at the Oxford University School of Geography and the Environment.

Requirements: you must have a version of the Secure Shell utility (ssh)
on your system. These instructions assume you are on a Unix system and have
some familiarity with Unix commands. You'll also need CVS (Concurrent
Version System) version 1.10 or later.

1. Because the repository is accessed using the Secure Shell (ssh) facility,
you will need to generate an RSA 1 key pair that will allow you to send and
receive encrypted transmissions. A key pair consists of a public key that can
be published  and a private key kept secret. You can do this by entering
"ssh-keygen -t rsa1" at the Unix command prompt if you are using openssh.
If your version of ssh is different, you are in unkown territory. Check out
the links below though and email us for support.
   To avoid to have to type a password at each connection, you can leave the
pass-phrase empty when generating the key pair.
  At this point and if you are using openssh, you should have two files
"$HOME/.ssh/identity" (private key) and "$HOME/.ssh/identity.pub" (public key)
where "$HOME" refers to your home directory location.

2. The public key consists of a long sequence of digits, and will be contained
in a file called "$HOME/.ssh/identity.pub". It looks like:
1024 37 11808017914819704306942080316151731399652927062198628732

4923319067042 foo@bar
 Using whatever method you prefer, copy the contents of this file and paste
them in an email message. Send it to Arnaud Desitter (email at the end),
explaining that you would like to be added to the CHILD repository list and
that this is your RSA 1 public key.

3. You now need to modify one of your startup files to tell CVS to use ssh
when accessing files on a remote system. If you're running a C shell (csh),
add the following line to the file .cshrc in your home directory:
  setenv CVS_RSH ssh
  Or, if you are using a Bourne shell (sh) add the following lines to the file
.profile in your home directory:
  CVS_RSH=ssh
  export CVS_RSH
  Or, if you have no idea which shell you're running, "echo $SHELL" may give
you a clue. Try as well "ypcat passwd | grep `whoami`" or
"cat /etc/passwd | grep `whoami`". At a last resort, try both -- chances are
only one of these two files (.cshrc and .profile) will exist anyway.
  You should only need to do this once.
  Then you have to re-load the start-up files to take into account this change.
The easiest way is to log out and log in.

Do the following steps only after your key has been added to the access list:

4. Test by entering at the unix prompt the following line:

ssh -l childcvs nimbus.geog.ox.ac.uk 'uname -a'

You should see something similar to:
SunOS nimbus.geog.ox.ac.uk 5.7 Generic_106541-19 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4

If it does not work, email us for help.

5. Navigate to the directory in which you wish to keep your snapshot (you
might want to create a new directory for it).

6. Enter the following command:

cvs -d:ext:childcvs@nimbus.geog.ox.ac.uk:/miami/miami2/childcvs/cvs checkout Child

You should then see a new directory called Child with a series of
subdirectories containing source code, documentation, example input files, etc.


7. A few tips about CVS

Information about using CVS is available at http://www.cvshome.org.
The cvs manual is available at http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/.

Some particularly useful commands are:
* cvs -nq update
  list the files that may need updating but do not update them..
* cvs update
  update your snapshot to the most current version in the repository.
* cvs -n diff -rHEAD
  shows a differences between your snapshot and the most current version
  in the repository.



If things go horribly wrong, it's likely that you're using an antiquated
version of ssh, so try updating this. Or if in total desperation, email
